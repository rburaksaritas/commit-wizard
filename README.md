# Commit Wizard

Commit Wizard is a python tool designed to automate the process of generating meaningful and descriptive commit messages for your Git repository. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API, this tool analyzes the changes in your codebase and generates commit messages that accurately reflect the modifications made, ensuring your project history is clear and informative.

## Features

- **Automatic Commit Message Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to generate descriptive commit messages based on the diffs of modified files.
- **Git Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your Git workflow to add, commit, and push changes with generated messages.
- **Configurable API Key and Model**: Specify your OpenAI API key and desired model in `config.py` file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rburaksaritas/commit-wizard.git
    cd commit-wizard
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have `openai` and other required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install openai
    ```

3. **Configure API Key and Model**:
    Modify the `config.py` file under the `src` directory to add your OpenAI API key:
    ```python
    OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
    MODEL = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
    ```
    You can also specify the model as desired.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The tool can be used directly from the command line. Here are the available options:

- **`repo_path`**: Path to the local Git repository.

- **`--file`**: (Optional) Specify one or more files to generate commits for. If absent, the program checks for all modified files.

- **`--ignore`**: (Optional) Specify one or more files or directories to ignore during commit message generation. `src/config.py` is ignored to prevent API key exposure.

- **`--push`**: (Optional) Branch name to push the changes. If not specified, the program will stage the changes and generate seperate commits for each file with generated commit messages, but it will not push them to the remote repository.

### Examples

1. **Generate commit messages and commit changes**:
    ```sh
    python3 main.py /path/to/repo
    ```

2. **Generate commit messages, commit changes, and push to a branch**:
    ```sh
    python3 main.py /path/to/repo --push main
    ```

3. **Specify files to generate commits for**:
    ```sh
    python3 main.py /path/to/repo --file src/pipeline.py main.py
    ```

4. **Ignore specific files or directories**:
    ```sh
    python3 main.py /path/to/repo --ignore src/config.py src/__pycache__
    ```

3. **Example Process used for adding sections to this README**:
    ```sh
    $Â python3 main.py ./commit-wizard --push main
